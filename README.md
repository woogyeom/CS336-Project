# CS336-Project
In this project, we designed and developed a flight management system for Group 24. The system allows users to search for flights, make reservations, view past and upcoming flights, and even join waiting lists if flights are fully booked. We built a robust database and integrated it with a simple web interface to ensure efficient management of users, flights, and airport information.

Key functionalities include: 

1. **User Features**:
   - Search for flights between airports, including options for one-way, round-trip, and flexible dates.
   - Sort and filter flight search results by criteria like price, flight duration, and take-off/landing time.
   - Make flight reservations, join waiting lists, view booking history, and receive alerts for seat availability.
   - Post questions to customer representatives.

2. **Admin Features**:
   - Add, edit, or delete customer and customer representative accounts.
   - Generate sales reports for specific months and produce summaries of revenue by flight, airline, or customer.
   - List reservations by flight number or customer, and identify the customer who generated the most revenue.
   - Identify the most active flights based on ticket sales.

3. **Customer Representative Features**:
   - Make and edit flight reservations on behalf of users.
   - Add, edit, or delete aircraft, airport, and flight information.
   - Retrieve waiting lists and produce a list of flights for a given airport.
   - Respond to user questions.

The system ensures seamless data storage, easy access, and efficient management of all relevant aviation-related data, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for both customers and administrators.
